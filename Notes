1. How to create a BoilerPlate React App ?
- Use the CreateReactApp via https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
- To create a project, run:
    npx create-react-app nameOfYourApp
    cd my-app
    npm start

Note: In our case we used: 
    npx create-react-app frontEnd   
        > Why FrontEnd ? Because we React is the frontEnd 
        > Once finished, it will create a boilerPlate React App in a folder called "frontend"

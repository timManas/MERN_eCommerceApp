Notes

1. How to create a BoilerPlate React App ?
- Use the CreateReactApp via https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
- To create a project, run:
    npx create-react-app nameOfYourApp
    cd my-app
    npm start

Note: In our case we used: 
    npx create-react-app frontEnd   
        > Why FrontEnd ? Because we React is the frontEnd 
        > Once finished, it will create a boilerPlate React App in a folder called "frontend"

2. How to start the application once CreateReactApp finishes ?
- Go to the frontend folder
- Type in:
    npm run
- Go to browser under http://localhost:3000

3. Where is your starting point ?
- It is the index.html file located in frontend > public 
- However, the starting point for react Apps is "index.js"  located in frontend > src

4. Regular syntax vs Arrow functions.
Both do the same thing
Regular Functional component  syntax:

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to ProShop</h1>
    </>
  )
}

Arrow Functional Components
const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to ProShop</h1>
    </>
  )
}

Q5. What are react Components ? 
Q6. What is React BootStrap ?
- Need to install Bootstrap first 

Q7. What is BootSwatch ?
- Free themes for bootstrap 
- Bootstrap files but customized to have different themes, colors, fonts ..etc

8. How to install BootSwatch and use them from Bootswatch ?
- Download theme on bootswatch under "bootstrap.min"
- Drag and Drop to src folder 
- Go into index.js and import using:
    import './bootstrap.min.css'
  
9. Note: Once you have bootstrap installed, Now you can install React-BootStrap

10. How to install React-BootStrap ?
- Note: Make sure you follow step 8 first and install bootstrap theme
- Run: 
  npm i react-bootstrap

Q11. What is a container ? 
Q12. How to use Containers in App ? 
Q13. What is cdnjs ?

Q14. Note: For this app, we use "font awesome", we use cdnJS to import it

15. How to use 'font awesome' into application ?
- Go to cdnJS
- Type in font awesome in search bar 
- Copy link tag
- Place in index.html in public folder 
Ex: Check in index.html for this line "<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.1/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha512-+4zCK9k+qNFUR5X+cKL9EIR+ZOhtIloNl9GIKS57V1MyNsYpYcUrUeQc9vNfzsWfV28IaLL3i96P9sdNyeRssA==" crossorigin="anonymous" />"
- Why ? So we can use icon classes 
- Now go to Header and add this line in:
  <i className='fas fa-shopping-cart'></i>
  <i className='fas fa-user'></i>
